title: Biodiversity assessment, monitoring, and conservation of Insects
---

Insects are the most diverse organisms on earth and play a crucial role in man-made as well as natural ecosystems. They are a major food source for many higher organisms in the food chain. Their interactions with plants and other animals play a crucial role in the functioning of ecosystems. However, insects have received very little attention from researchers and are understudied. Especially in the tropics, the biology, ecology, and conservation status of many insect species is unknown. Many tropical insect species are disappearing at an alarming rate. It is thought that some may go extinct even before their discovery by humans. Therefore, it is essential to assess insect diversity, distribution, abundance, and conservation status in the tropics. The Western Ghats of India are a biodiversity hotspot. However, the northern part of the Western Ghats is less explored and studied. Our research will focus on biodiversity assessment, monitoring, and conservation of insects in the Northern Western Ghats. We plan to develop tools and technology that will help in the assessment, long term monitoring, and conservation of insects.
