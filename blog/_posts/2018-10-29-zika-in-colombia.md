Healthy ecosystems are essential for biodiversity conservation. Insect pollinators
play a key role in the sustainability of ecosystems by pollinating and regenerating flowering plants. Insect pollinators are declining rapidly due to anthropogenic factors such as the use of pesticides, habitat loss, changes in land use, and the introduction of exotic/invasive species. A further decline in pollinator insects is expected in the wake of climate change. However, data on the status and trends of insect pollinators is limited and geographically largely restricted to Europe and North America. In India, native bees are key pollinators of natural and agricultural ecosystems. Unfortunately, their ecology and trends are understudied, which makes it difficult to assess their conservation status. We plan to study the ecology of native bees and the characteristics of their habitat. Our goal is to assess the spatial and temporal variation in bee pollinator diversity and abundance and the factors influencing them.
