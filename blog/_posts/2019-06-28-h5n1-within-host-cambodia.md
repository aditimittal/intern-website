title: Molecular Genetic Mechanisms Underlying Stress Response of Insects

Insects live in an uncertain and variable environment and are subjected to multiple stressors during their lifetimes. These include abiotic stressors, such as temperature, light, and water, and biotic stressors like predators and pathogens. Additionally, human induced factors such as chemical pollutants, pesticides, and invasive species are major stressors affecting insects today. Insects respond to stressors in three different ways: by evolutionary adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, and dispersal. These responses alter interactions of insects with their environment, as well as with other organisms in the ecosystem. Our lab primarily works with aphids, small sap sucking insects that cause damage to plants by feeding and transmitting viruses. We use bioinformatics, genetics, and genomics to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying plastic as well as adaptive responses of insects to environmental stressors.
