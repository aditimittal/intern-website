Sustainable and productive agroecosystems are needed to enhance overall ecosystem health and resilience, as well as food security. One important ecosystem service provided by insects in agroecosystems is pollination. Approximately 70% of tropical crop species depend on pollinators for optimum yields. However, human induced decline in insect pollinators has been reported all over the world. Therefore, pollination limitation is one of the biggest threats to crops. Native honey bees are major pollinators of crops in India. In addition to the essential pollination services that improve crop yield and quality, they provide honey, wax, bee pollen, propolis, and royal jelly, which are valuable for human livelihood. The decline of native honey bees and the consequent decrease in crop pollination and yield will have severe consequences for the livelihoods of marginal and small holding farmers in India. Therefore, honeybee conservation is essential, and for conservation, it is crucial to understand their ecology. We are developing novel technological approaches based on acoustic sensors and tagging to understand and monitor interactions between crops and native honey bees. Our goal is to assess honey bee diversity, abundance, and patterns in different crops of economic importance.
