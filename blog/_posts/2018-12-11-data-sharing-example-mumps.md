Pest insects cause damage to crop plants and threaten food security by reducing crop yield. The annual economic losses due to pest insects in agriculture are in billions of dollars worldwide. Typically, control and management of crop insects is done using pesticides. However, the pesticides are a hazard for the environment, other organisms in the ecosystem, and human health. Therefore, health and environment friendly methods of pest insect control are needed, which calls for an understanding of the ecology and evolution of pest insects. 

There are around 4000 known species of aphids in the world. Some of these aphid species are considered a major pest of agricultural importance, as they cause severe losses in economically important crops, including soybeans, wheat, cowpeas, groundnuts, beans, and other cereal crops. Our lab investigates the interactions between aphids and crop plants, as well as between aphids and their ladybird beetle predators, to explore the potential of sustainable pest control strategies such as host plant resistance and biological control. 

Biological control is an important tool in integrated pest management. Ladybird beetles aid crop protection by feeding on and suppressing the populations of aphids and other soft bodied insects. We use a combination of field and lab experiments to understand the interactions between aphids and their ladybird predators. We use next generation sequencing technology to understand transcriptomic changes in aphids in response to stress caused by a combination of predators and abiotic factors.
